    <h2>About Me</h2>
    <p>Welcome to my website! I'm a Data Analyst with a background in physics, passionate about coding, design, data science, and AI.
         Since childhood, my curiosity has driven me to ask deep questions about the universe and how things work.
         Observing nature at a young age shaped my ability to perceive real-world phenomena with an open mind.
         This fascination led me on a lifelong journey to understand the fundamental laws of nature and the mysteries of the world.

         I pursued my studies at Uni Leipzig, where I developed a strong analytical foundation that I’m eager to apply in the field of data analytics.
         With expertise in uncovering insights, optimizing processes, and enabling data-driven decision-making, I strive to transform complex data into meaningful insights.
         I have a keen ability to bridge technical and business needs, using data visualization and storytelling to communicate findings effectively.
         My interests lie in leveraging analytics to drive impact, particularly in logistics and operations.
        
         Beyond analytics, I'm passionate about coding, experimentation, and continuous learning—always seeking new ways to push the boundaries of data science and AI.
         I'm excited to take the next step in my career and contribute to meaningful projects in this space. </p>
